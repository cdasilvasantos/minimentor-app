### **Project Idea: “MiniMentor” – AI-Generated Career Advice Clips**

#### 💼 **Overview:**
Turn bite-sized, personalized career advice into stylish, short video content. Users input a job role, career challenge, or question, and your tool generates a motivational video with an AI-written script, matching image, and narrated audio to post on platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, and TikTok.

### **🧠 Workflow (Text > Photo > Audio > Video):**

#### **Step 1: Text**
- User enters a prompt like:
  - “I’m a software engineering student, give me advice for job interviews.”
  - “What’s the best way to deal with imposter syndrome in design?”
- Use **OpenAI GPT-4** to:
  - Generate a 3–5 sentence script of encouraging and actionable advice
  - Include a suggestion for an image concept and tone (e.g., “a confident woman walking into a modern office – warm lighting, motivational vibe”)

#### **Step 2: Photo**
- Use **DALL·E** (via OpenAI) to generate the background image based on the visual prompt.

#### **Step 3: Audio**
- Use OpenAI again to:
  - Slightly tweak the script to fit a conversational tone if needed
  - Optional: integrate with a free voiceover tool (like TTS from Google or ElevenLabs trial) to generate narration

#### **Step 4: Video**
- Combine image + voiceover + light background music using **FFmpeg** or tools like CapCut/Premiere if desired
- Add animated subtitles using auto-captioning (can be scripted too)
