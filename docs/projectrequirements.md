Overview
For your final project, you will design and develop a mobile or mobile-responsive application that integrates AI functionality via an external API (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Stability AI, Hugging Face, etc.).

You are free to choose any framework for this project.
You can build either:

A native mobile app (e.g., Flutter, React Native, Swift, Kotlin, etc.)

OR a mobile-optimized web app (e.g., Next.js, React, Vue, Svelte)

Your application should:

Demonstrate strong mobile-first UI/UX principles

Integrate a useful AI-powered feature

Showcase creativity, technical skill, and clear project organization

Requirements
1. Technology
You may use any framework that supports mobile app or responsive web development.

Your app must work well on mobile devices.

2. AI Integration
You must integrate at least one AI-powered feature using a public API.

Example AI services you can use:

OpenAI (ChatGPT, DALL·E, Whisper, etc.)

Anthropic Claude

Stability AI (image generation)

Hugging Face APIs

Other public AI APIs (with instructor approval)

3. Application Requirements
At least three (3) screens/pages (examples: Home, AI interaction page, Results/Settings).

Persist some user data (local storage, lightweight database, or session memory).

Mobile-first user experience (responsive design, intuitive navigation).

Basic authentication/login (optional for extra credit).

4. Deliverables
GitHub Repository containing your project code.

README.md must include:

App name and short description

Technologies used (frameworks, libraries, APIs)

Explanation of AI integration

Setup instructions (how to run the app locally)

(Optional) Future improvements

5-Minute Presentation during the final exam period:

Live demonstration of the app

Explain your project goals, technologies used, and AI feature

Share challenges faced and lessons learned

✅ Your project description must be clearly written inside your README.md.

✅ You must submit your GitHub repository link before your final exam day.
